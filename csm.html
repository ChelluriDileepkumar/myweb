        <h1> CSE and PYTHON MATTER </h1>
        <h3>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a field that deals with the theory, design, development, and application of computer systems and software. It encompasses a wide range of topics 
including algorithms, data structures, programming languages, computer architecture, operating systems, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.

CSE is an ever-evolving field at the forefront of technological advancement, driving innovation across various industries. Professionals in this field are involved in creating new 
technologies, solving complex problems, and developing software solutions to address real-world challenges.

With the increasing reliance on technology in nearly every aspect of modern life, the demand for skilled computer scientists and engineers continues to grow. Careers in CSE offer 
opportunities for creative problem-solving, collaboration, and the chance to make a significant impact on society through technological advancements.

Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers alike. With Python, you can 
create a wide range of programs, from simple scripts to complex applications and everything in between.

In this program, print("Hello, world!") is the main statement. It's responsible for printing the text "Hello, world!" to the console. The print() function is a built-in Python function used to display output.

Python programs typically start with comments providing information about the program, such as its purpose, author, and creation date. Comments in Python start with the # symbol, and they're ignored by the 
Python interpreter. They're primarily used for documentation and explanation purposes.

Python programs can consist of multiple lines of code, with each line performing a specific task. You can use various control structures such as loops (for loops, while loops), conditional 
statements (if, else, elif), and functions to create more complex programs.

In this program:
We define a function factorial(n) to calculate the factorial of a given number recursively.
We prompt the user to enter a number using the input() function and convert the input to an integer using int().
We use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle different cases: negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.
We call the factorial() function to calculate and print the factorial of the entered number.
Python's simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries make it an excellent choice for developing a wide range of programs, from small scripts to large-scale applications. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a powerful and enjoyable programming experience.</h3>
